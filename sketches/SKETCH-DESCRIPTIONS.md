# Description of Sketches

Describe your sketches here.
- What did you sketch, which sketches correspond to which part of the sketching process?

Attached is the first and only sketch I sketched since I quite liked my first sketch. A few modifications were made to the final product.
- Which one did you end up choosing and why?

I only needed one sketch because I already had a rough idea of what the final product looks like in my head. The design is inspired from MacOS's built-in note app called "Notes".
